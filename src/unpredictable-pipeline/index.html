                        <p class="faq__answer">A GTM Infrastructure Firm diagnoses and repairs the structural failures in your go-to-market system - the architecture that determines whether your company can reliably convert market opportunity into revenue. Unlike agencies that rent you activity, we install systems you own: ICP architecture, message engineering, channel strategy, and execution frameworks. The output is a revenue engine that compounds, not a retainer that depletes.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">How is Remotir different from a sales agency or SDR outsourcing firm?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Agencies sell activity - calls made, emails sent, meetings booked. We fix architecture - the structural reasons those activities don't convert. Most startups don't have a "more activity" problem; they have a targeting problem, a messaging problem, or a channel-stage mismatch problem. Agencies add volume to a broken system. We diagnose the system, repair it, then run it. When our engagement ends, you own infrastructure that keeps working.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">What is the 4 Lens Framework?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">The 4 Lens Framework is Remotir's diagnostic architecture for demand generation. Profitable customer acquisition requires four conditions to be true simultaneously: precise ICP Architecture (reaching exact-fit buyers), Message Engineering (articulating pain better than buyers can), Channel Selection (matching channel economics to stage and ICP), and Execution Discipline (creative, copy, and operational velocity). Miss any one lens, and the system fails. Our diagnostic identifies which lens is broken.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">What causes unpredictable pipeline?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Unpredictable pipeline is a symptom of architectural failure, not an execution problem. Common causes: approximate ICP targeting (leads that "sort of fit"), messaging that describes features instead of pain, channel-stage mismatch (wrong channel for your economics), qualification debt (deals in pipeline that were never real), and lack of inspection cadence. Our Pipeline Physics playbook details the mechanics of forecast accuracy and how to engineer predictability.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">How do you approach outbound that's failed before?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Failed outbound is usually a diagnostic problem, not a volume problem. We audit across the 4 Lenses: Was targeting approximate or precise? Did messaging describe features or articulate pain? Was the channel appropriate for your stage and economics? Was execution velocity high enough to outpace creative fatigue? Most failures trace to one or two specific lenses. We fix those, then rebuild the system around what actually works.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">How does your pricing work?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">We use success-aligned pricing: a flat monthly fee based on your stage, plus a 15% revenue share on closed deals. The fee covers infrastructure installation and operation. The revenue share ensures our incentives are perfectly aligned - we only win big when you win big. This structure makes us invested in your long-term revenue, not just short-term activity metrics.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">Why is there a 3-month minimum engagement?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Revenue infrastructure isn't built overnight. Month one: diagnosis, ICP architecture, message engineering. Month two: system installation, campaign launch, initial iteration. Month three: optimization against real data, handover of assets, and ideally - closed revenue. Shorter engagements produce shallow fixes. We build systems designed to compound over years, which requires enough time to install properly.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">How long before we see results?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Most clients see qualified pipeline activity - replies, discovery calls, sales conversations - within 3-4 weeks of campaign launch. Closed revenue timing depends on your sales cycle length and deal complexity. We treat this as system installation, not a stunt. The goal is a repeatable engine, not a one-time spike.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">How involved do I need to be as founder?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Heavily in weeks 1-2 (diagnosis, ICP definition, messaging validation). Lightly in weeks 3-12 (weekly reviews, strategic decisions, sales handoffs). We need your domain expertise and buyer intuition upfront to build accurate architecture. After that, we operate the system and surface what requires your attention. The goal is to multiply your GTM capacity, not add to your calendar.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">Can you help with landing pages and messaging - not just outbound?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Yes - these are often the highest-leverage fixes. Your landing page is your conversion infrastructure. If it doesn't articulate pain, handle objections, and compel action, no amount of traffic will convert. Messaging engineering is Lens 2 of our 4 Lens Framework. We rebuild pages and copy as part of the system installation, not as a separate "design project."</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">What results have you delivered for similar companies?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Outcomes vary by stage and starting point. Recent engagements: a Series A SaaS went from "1-2 meetings per week" to "7 valid MQLs being nurtured through sales." A pre-seed founder reached $30K closed ARR in 6 weeks. A £20M Series A validation. A 137x ACV increase after pivot. A 66% efficiency gain in an existing GTM system. We document case studies with specific before/after metrics because vague claims are worthless.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">Do you work with companies outside B2B SaaS?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Our frameworks are stage-agnostic but buyer-model-specific. The 4 Lens Framework applies to any company with a defined buyer, a sales cycle, and unit economics that need to work. Most of our clients are B2B SaaS at seed to Series B because that's where GTM infrastructure failures are most lethal - and most fixable. If you're not sure, book a diagnostic call.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">How is Remotir different from a marketing or sales agency?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Agencies rent you activity - campaigns, calls, meetings booked. They're optimized for deliverables, not outcomes. Remotir is a GTM Infrastructure Firm: we diagnose the structural reasons your current activities don't convert, install systems that fix those failures, then operate the engine until you're ready to own it. Agencies add volume to your existing system. We rebuild the system itself. When the engagement ends, you own infrastructure that keeps compounding - not a gap where the agency used to be.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">How is Remotir different from hiring a fractional CRO?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">A fractional CRO gives you strategic advice and leadership bandwidth - valuable, but they don't come with an execution team. You still need to hire, manage, and operate. Remotir provides the complete stack: diagnosis, strategy, systems design, AND operators who execute. We're not advisors who tell you what to do; we're infrastructure builders who do it with you. A fractional CRO might say "you need better ICP targeting." We define the ICP, build the lists, write the sequences, run the campaigns, and hand you qualified pipeline.</p>

                        <h3 class="faq__question">What's the difference between lead generation and Remotir's demand generation approach?</h3>
                        <p class="faq__answer">Lead generation optimizes for volume: more names, more emails, more "leads" in the CRM. The problem is most leads aren't ready to buy, creating qualification debt and wasted sales cycles. Remotir's demand generation approach - built on the 4 Lens Framework - optimizes for revenue efficiency: reaching exact-fit buyers (ICP Architecture), with messaging that articulates their pain (Message Engineering), through channels matched to your economics (Channel Selection), with the velocity to outpace creative fatigue (Execution Discipline). We'd rather generate 10 qualified opportunities than 1,000 names that never convert.</p>
