                    <h2>The Founder Trap</h2>
                    <p>There is a moment in every successful startup where the founder becomes the bottleneck. It usually happens between $20k and $50k MRR.</p>
                    <p>The founder knows the pitch. The founder handles objections. The founder closes contracts. The founder does onboarding. <strong>The founder is the sales team.</strong> And a one-person sales team cannot scale.</p>
                    <p>The obvious solution is to hire salespeople. The problem is that <strong>67% of first sales hires at early-stage startups fail to meet quota.</strong> The failure rate is not a reflection of bad candidates. It is a reflection of bad handoffs.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Why the First Sales Hire Fails</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Founder closes deals through improvisation. Each conversation is unique.</li>
                        <li>Founder hires a salesperson. Assumes the rep will "figure it out."</li>
                        <li>Rep shadows founder. Watches the magic but cannot replicate it.</li>
                        <li>Rep attempts solo calls. Lacks the context and credibility the founder has.</li>
                        <li>Rep underperforms. Founder blames the hire. Fires and tries again.</li>
                        <li>Cycle repeats.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>The root cause is not hiring. The root cause is that the founder never extracted the process from their own head.</strong></p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>What the Founder Has (That the Rep Doesn't)</h2>
                    <p><strong>Deep Product Knowledge:</strong> The founder built it. They understand every feature, limitation, and roadmap item. A rep has surface-level training.</p>
                    <p><strong>Credibility by Default:</strong> "I'm the CEO" signals seriousness. The prospect treats the conversation differently.</p>
                    <p><strong>Improvisation Capacity:</strong> The founder can deviate from script because they understand the underlying logic. A rep without that understanding must follow the script exactly.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>The Sales Extraction Audit</h2>
                    <p>Before hiring, the founder must extract the sales process from their own head. This is the <strong>Sales Extraction Audit</strong>.</p>
                    <h3>Component 1: The Documented Sales Process</h3>
                    <p>Every stage of the sales process, from first touch to closed deal, must be documented with specific actions, templates, and success criteria.</p>
                    <h3>Component 2: The Objection Library</h3>
                    <p>Every objection the founder has encountered, with the response that worked. Not "handle objections." Specific objections with specific responses.</p>
                    <h3>Component 3: The ICP Checklist</h3>
                    <p>Specific, observable criteria that identify a qualified prospect. Not "decision-makers at growing companies." Specific titles, company signals, and trigger events.</p>
                    <h3>Component 4: The Demo Script</h3>
                    <p>The exact flow of a successful demo, with talk tracks for each section. What to show, when to show it, what to say.</p>
                    <h3>Component 5: The Closing Framework</h3>
                    <p>How does the founder ask for the sale? What language works? What timeline is typical? Document it.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>The Bus Test</h2>
                    <p>The heuristic for Sales Extraction completeness: <strong>"If the founder were hit by a bus tomorrow, could someone else close deals using only written documentation?"</strong></p>
                    <p>If no, extraction is incomplete. If yes, you are ready to hire.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <h2>Conclusion: Extract Before You Hire</h2>
                    <p>The first sales hire fails not because founders hire the wrong people. It fails because founders hand over a job without handing over the playbook.</p>
                    <p>The Sales Extraction Audit transforms founder intuition into organizational capability. It is not optional. It is the prerequisite to scalable revenue.</p>
                    <p><strong>Extract the process. Then make the hire.</strong></p>
