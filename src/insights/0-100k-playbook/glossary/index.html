                    <p><strong>Challenger Pivot:</strong> The moment in a sales conversation where the seller challenges the prospect's assumptions, reframing the status quo as a high-risk liability. <em>(Chapter 5)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>Channel-Stage Fit Matrix:</strong> A framework mapping acquisition channels to company stages based on economic viability. <em>(Chapter 8)</em></p>

                    <h2>F</h2>
                    <p><strong>Forensic Persona Audit:</strong> An economic targeting system that defines buyers by Trigger Event, Economic Authority, and Bleeding Neck Metric - not demographics. <em>(Chapter 4)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Painkiller Narrative:</strong> A messaging structure built around Diagnosis, Cost Calculation, Status Quo Risk, and Resolution - leading with pain rather than possibility. <em>(Chapter 5)</em></p>
                    <p><strong>PMF Threshold Test:</strong> A four-part diagnostic for product-market fit: 40% Test, Repeatability Test, Stranger Test, and Retention Test. <em>(Chapter 6)</em></p>

                    <p><strong>Stranger Test:</strong> A validation filter that excludes warm network contacts. True validation requires demand from buyers outside the founder's existing relationships. <em>(Chapter 1)</em></p>

                    <h2>T</h2>
                    <p><strong>The $10k MRR Trap:</strong> The phenomenon where startups stall between $5k-$15k MRR because they confuse early traction with product-market fit. <em>(Chapter 6)</em></p>

                    <hr>
                    <h2>Playbook Summary</h2>
                    <p><strong>Phase 1: Validation</strong> proves that a specific buyer will pay for a specific solution - before writing code.</p>
                    <p><strong>Phase 2: Positioning</strong> constructs a narrative and targeting system that makes buying feel inevitable.</p>
                    <p><strong>Phase 3: Scaling</strong> builds the infrastructure that makes growth repeatable.</p>
                    <p><strong>The $100k milestone is not a celebration. It is a diagnostic.</strong> The founders who treat it as an examination - auditing repeatability, retention, and economics - are the founders who scale beyond it.</p>
