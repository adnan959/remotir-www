                <p><strong>Segment-Level Coverage:</strong> Coverage analysis broken down by segment (SMB/Mid-Market/Enterprise), source, or time horizon. Reveals allocation imbalances hidden by aggregate metrics. <em>(Chapter 6)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Seller-Centric Stages:</strong> Stage definitions based on seller activities (discovery completed, demo delivered). These measure effort, not progress, and cannot reliably predict outcomes. <em>(Chapters 1, 3)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Signal Pattern Recognition:</strong> The practice of assessing deal risk based on combinations of Stall Signals. Yellow (caution), Orange (at risk), Red (critical) status levels guide intervention intensity. <em>(Chapter 8)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Skip-Level Trap:</strong> The dysfunction where senior leaders inspect individual deals (which undermines first-line managers) instead of inspecting the inspection system. <em>(Chapter 9)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Stability Principle:</strong> The observation that conversion rates cluster around a stable baseline when qualification and stage architecture are rigorous. Deviation from baseline signals underlying change. <em>(Chapter 4)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Stage Conversion Baseline:</strong> The historical average conversion rate between two adjacent stages. Serves as the benchmark for diagnosing deviation and projecting outcomes. <em>(Chapter 4)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Stage Integrity:</strong> The degree to which stage definitions are meaningful, exit criteria are enforced, and deals in each stage actually meet the stated criteria. A prerequisite for forecast reliability. <em>(Chapter 3)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Stall Signals:</strong> Observable behaviors that correlate with deal failure. Include engagement signals (champion dark, meeting quality decline), process signals (timeline slips, internal alignment delays), competition signals (new questions, proposal revisits), and decision signals (decision maker absent, urgency fading). <em>(Chapter 8)</em></p>
                
                <h2>T</h2>
                
                <p><strong>The Three Lies:</strong> The foundational assumptions that guarantee forecast failure: (1) deals in pipeline belong there, (2) stages indicate probability, (3) close dates are real. All three must be addressed for forecasting to become reliable. <em>(Chapter 1)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>The Three-Question Framework:</strong> The diagnostic core of effective inspection: (1) What changed since last review? (2) What is the next buyer action? (3) What is blocking that action? <em>(Chapter 9)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Threshold Violation Rate:</strong> The percentage of current pipeline that exceeds Days-in-Stage Thresholds. A leading indicator of forecast risk and pipeline health. <em>(Chapter 5)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Time Tax:</strong> The hidden cost of unqualified pipeline in rep hours. Unqualified deals require disproportionate follow-up and management attention, stealing time from deals that could close. <em>(Chapter 2)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Time-Boxing:</strong> The practice of limiting deal discussions to a fixed duration (typically 3-5 minutes) to maintain review efficiency and prevent narrative dominance. <em>(Chapter 9)</em></p>
                
                <h2>U</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Upside (Forecast Category):</strong> Deals that should close this period, pending resolution of identified factors. Requires: champion confirmed intent, decision timeline within period, budget identified, known factors to resolution documented. <em>(Chapter 7)</em></p>
                
                <h2>V</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Velocity-Adjusted Forecasting:</strong> Forecasting methodology that modifies stage probability based on deal age. Produces more accurate projections than stage-only weighting. <em>(Chapter 5)</em></p>
                
                <p><strong>Velocity Decay Rate:</strong> The rate at which probability decreases for each week a deal exceeds its threshold. Typically 5-10% per week depending on stage. <em>(Chapter 5)</em></p>

                <h2>W</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Weighted Probability Matrix:</strong> The methodology of assigning calibrated probabilities to each forecast category and calculating expected value by weighting deal values accordingly. <em>(Chapter 7)</em></p>
                
                <h2>Z</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Zombie Deals:</strong> Opportunities that remain in pipeline far beyond reasonable close timelines. Consume resources and corrupt metrics without corresponding probability of closing. <em>(Chapter 5)</em></p>
